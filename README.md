# Auto-calibration-of-line-sensors

**Hi!**

This script allows you to get a coefficient for working with analog sensors of the line according to the following formula - ```(the current value of the analog signal + the minimum value of the signal) / 2```. Thus, you can get comfortable values for working with the movement of the robot using arduino sensors.
